# lkr cli

## Usage

`uv` makes everyone's life easier. Go [install it](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

## Login

See the [prerequisites section](#prerequisites)

Login to `lkr`

```bash
uv run --with lkr-dev-cli lkr auth login
```

- Select a new instance
- Put the url of your Looker instance (e.g. https://acme.cloud.looker.com)
- Choose whether you want this login to use production or development mode
- Give it a name

You will be redirected to the Looker OAuth authorization page, click Allow. If you do not see an allow button, the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) were not done properly.

If everything is successful, you will see `Successfully authenticated!`

## MCP
Built into the `lkr` is an MCP server. Right now its tools are based on helping you work within an IDE. To use it a tool like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), add this to your mcp.json

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lkr-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--with", "lkr-dev-cli", "lkr", "mcp", "run"]
    }
  }
}
```


## Prerequisites

If this if the first time you're using the Language Server, you'll need to register a new OAuth client to communicate with `lkr` cli.

`lkr` uses OAuth2 to authenticate to Looker and manages the authentication lifecycle for you. A Looker Admin will need to Register a new OAuth client to communicate with the Language Server:

Go to the Looker API Explorer for Register OAuth App (https://your.looker.instance/extensions/marketplace_extension_api_explorer::api-explorer/4.0/methods/Auth/register_oauth_client_app)

- Enter lkr-cli as the client_id
- Enter the following payload in the body

```json
{
  "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:8000/callback",
  "display_name": "LKR",
  "description": "lkr.dev language server, MCP and CLI",
  "enabled": true
}
```

- Check the "I Understand" box and click the Run button
- This only needs to be done once per instance
